## SVG images merger
This approach can be used only on simply svg images which contain only pathes and no other elements. For using it is necessary to add your SVG pictures colections and update **getRandCombination** function in *constructor.js* file for working with them. Now this fuction works with only two folders of assets but it's possible to add more.
